Task Requirements:

1. Sensor Data Collection:
Simulate sensor readings by generating dummy data (e.g., temperature
values between 20°C and 30°C).
Upon waking up from deep sleep, continuously read this dummy sensor
value for 5 seconds.
Store all readings taken during this 5-second period.
2. Kalman Filtering:
Task Brief: ESP32 Sensor Data Collection, Filtering, and Transmission 2
Apply a Kalman filter to the collected sensor data to reduce noise and
improve accuracy.
3. Power Management:
After each sensor reading session, the ESP32 should enter deep sleep
mode for the remaining time in the 10-second interval.
The ESP32 should automatically wake up for the next reading session.
4. Data Aggregation:
Aggregate the filtered readings from five wakeup cycles before sending
them to the server.
Store the aggregated data in a buffer until all five cycles are complete.

Here’s how you can create this scenario in FreeRTOS for the ESP32, step by step:
1. Sensor Data Collection Task

    Generate dummy sensor readings (e.g., temperature values between 20°C and 30°C).
    Upon waking up from deep sleep, continuously read the sensor for 5 seconds and store the readings.

c

void sensorTask(void *pvParameters) {
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();
    const TickType_t xFrequency = pdMS_TO_TICKS(5000);  // 5 seconds
    float sensorData[100];  // Array to hold sensor readings
    int index = 0;
    
    while (1) {
        // Read sensor for 5 seconds
        for (index = 0; index < 100; index++) {
            // Generate dummy temperature value between 20°C and 30°C
            sensorData[index] = 20.0 + (float)(rand() % 1000) / 100.0;
            vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(50));  // Delay 50ms between each reading
        }
        // After 5 seconds, apply Kalman filter to sensor data
        applyKalmanFilter(sensorData, 100);
        vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, xFrequency);  // 5 seconds period
    }
}

2. Kalman Filter

Apply the Kalman filter to the collected sensor data to reduce noise.

c

void applyKalmanFilter(float *data, int length) {
    // Dummy Kalman filter implementation (you can replace this with a real one)
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        data[i] = (data[i] + data[i > 0 ? i - 1 : 0]) / 2.0;  // Simplified filter
    }
}

3. Power Management

Put the ESP32 into deep sleep after every reading session and wake up for the next one.

c

void deepSleepTask(void *pvParameters) {
    while (1) {
        // Go into deep sleep for 10 seconds
        esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(10000000);  // 10 seconds
        esp_deep_sleep_start();
    }
}

4. Data Aggregation

Aggregate the filtered sensor data over 5 wakeup cycles before sending it to the server.

c

float aggregatedData[500];  // Buffer for aggregated data
int cycleCount = 0;

void aggregateData(float *sensorData, int length) {
    // Store sensor data in the aggregation buffer
    memcpy(&aggregatedData[cycleCount * length], sensorData, length * sizeof(float));
    cycleCount++;
    
    // Once 5 cycles are complete, send data to server
    if (cycleCount == 5) {
        sendDataToServer(aggregatedData, 500);
        cycleCount = 0;  // Reset cycle count
    }
}

void sendDataToServer(float *data, int length) {
    // Code to send data to the server (e.g., via WiFi or BLE)
}

5. RTOS Tasks Creation

Create tasks in FreeRTOS for sensor reading, Kalman filtering, and deep sleep.

c

void app_main() {
    xTaskCreate(sensorTask, "Sensor Task", 2048, NULL, 5, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(deepSleepTask, "Deep Sleep Task", 2048, NULL, 2, NULL);
    // Start scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();
}

Explanation:

    Sensor Task: Simulates sensor data and runs every 5 seconds.
    Kalman Filtering: Applied to each set of sensor readings.
    Deep Sleep Task: Manages power consumption by putting the ESP32 to sleep for 10 seconds.
    Data Aggregation: Collects data over 5 cycles before transmission.

This setup uses FreeRTOS tasks to manage sensor readings, filtering, power management, and data aggregation.


There is an issue in the code when you try to assign RsensorData = ptrsensorData; because RsensorData is an array, and arrays in C cannot be assigned directly.

Here’s a corrected version of the code that copies the values of sensorData to RsensorData:

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10U

typedef float sensorData_t[ARRAY_SIZE];
sensorData_t sensorData, *ptrsensorData;
sensorData_t RsensorData;

int main() {
    // Initialize sensorData
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        sensorData[i] = i;
    }

    // Point ptrsensorData to sensorData
    ptrsensorData = sensorData; // No need for '&' since sensorData is already an array (i.e., pointer to the first element)

    // Copy the data from sensorData (or ptrsensorData) to RsensorData
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        RsensorData[i] = (*ptrsensorData)[i]; // Dereference and copy values
    }

    // Print the copied data to verify
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        printf("RsensorData[%d] = %.2f\n", i, RsensorData[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

    Array Assignment: Arrays in C are not assignable directly. To copy the data from sensorData to RsensorData, you need to copy each element individually using a loop.
    Pointer Dereferencing: ptrsensorData points to sensorData, and to access the elements it points to, dereferencing is done as (*ptrsensorData)[i].
    Verification: A printf loop is added to print the values of RsensorData to verify the copy operation.

This code will compile and run correctly in any C environment.
You said:
typedef float sensorData_t[ARRAY_SIZE];

 sensorData_t sensorData,*ptrsensorData; 

 for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        sensorData[i] = i;
    }
   ptrsensorData = &sensorData;
   
   xQueueSend(myQueue,(void*)&ptrsensorData,0);

There’s a small issue in your code snippet. The expression ptrsensorData = &sensorData; is problematic because sensorData is an array, and in C, arrays decay into pointers to their first element. So, sensorData itself is already a pointer to the first element, and taking the address of it would be incorrect.

Additionally, when sending to the queue using xQueueSend, you need to send the data itself, not the pointer to the data pointer unless that’s your specific intention.

Here’s the corrected version with explanations:
Corrected Code

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
#include <freertos/queue.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10U

typedef float sensorData_t[ARRAY_SIZE];

sensorData_t sensorData;
sensorData_t *ptrsensorData;

QueueHandle_t myQueue;

void someFunction() {
    // Initialize the array
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        sensorData[i] = i;
    }

    // Point to the sensorData
    ptrsensorData = &sensorData; // Corrected: sensorData already decays into a pointer

    // Send the data pointer to the queue (not the address of the pointer)
    xQueueSend(myQueue, (void*)&ptrsensorData, 0);  // Sending pointer to sensorData array
}

Explanation:

    Array Decay: sensorData decays into a pointer to its first element when used in most expressions. Therefore, ptrsensorData = &sensorData; would result in an invalid pointer because &sensorData becomes a pointer to a pointer. The correct assignment is ptrsensorData = sensorData; or ptrsensorData = &sensorData; as needed.

    Queue Send: When using xQueueSend, you are sending data to the queue. If you want to send the pointer to the array (ptrsensorData), you pass (void*)&ptrsensorData. This will store the address of the pointer in the queue, allowing the receiving task to access the sensor data.

    Queue Initialization (important): Ensure that myQueue is initialized properly using xQueueCreate before calling xQueueSend. For example:

    c

    myQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(sensorData_t*)); // Create a queue to hold pointers to sensor data

By doing this, you ensure that the pointer to your sensorData array is properly passed through the queue. The receiving task can then dereference the pointer to access the actual sensor data.

To receive data from a queue in FreeRTOS, you use the xQueueReceive function. Since you're sending a pointer to an array (ptrsensorData) via the queue, you'll need to properly handle the pointer when receiving it.

Here’s how you can receive data from the queue in the correct way:
Sending Data to the Queue:

You’ve already sent the pointer to sensorData using:

c

xQueueSend(myQueue, (void*)&ptrsensorData, 0);

Receiving Data from the Queue:

When receiving the data, you need to receive a pointer to the array (i.e., a pointer to ptrsensorData). After receiving it, you can dereference it to access the actual sensor data.

Here’s the full implementation for both sending and receiving:
Full Example: Sending and Receiving Data via Queue

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
#include <freertos/task.h>
#include <freertos/queue.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10U

typedef float sensorData_t[ARRAY_SIZE];

sensorData_t sensorData;
sensorData_t *ptrsensorData;  // Pointer to sensorData

QueueHandle_t myQueue;

void senderTask(void *params) {
    // Initialize sensorData with some values
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        sensorData[i] = i;  // Assign values to the array
    }

    // Point ptrsensorData to sensorData array
    ptrsensorData = &sensorData;

    // Send the pointer to the sensorData array to the queue
    xQueueSend(myQueue, (void*)&ptrsensorData, 0);

    vTaskDelete(NULL);  // Delete the task when done
}

void receiverTask(void *params) {
    sensorData_t *receivedDataPtr;  // A pointer to hold the received data

    // Receive the pointer from the queue
    if (xQueueReceive(myQueue, (void*)&receivedDataPtr, portMAX_DELAY)) {
        // Dereference the pointer to access the actual data
        for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
            printf("Received sensorData[%d] = %.2f\n", i, (*receivedDataPtr)[i]);
        }
    }

    vTaskDelete(NULL);  // Delete the task when done
}

int main() {
    // Create a queue to hold pointers to sensor data
    myQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(sensorData_t*));  // Queue for pointers

    // Create sender and receiver tasks
    xTaskCreate(senderTask, "Sender Task", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(receiverTask, "Receiver Task", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);

    // Start the FreeRTOS scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    return 0;  // This point should never be reached as the scheduler will take over
}

Explanation:

    Queue Creation:
        myQueue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(sensorData_t*)); creates a queue that can hold 10 pointers to arrays (sensorData_t*).

    Sender Task:
        The senderTask initializes the sensorData array and then sends the pointer ptrsensorData (which points to the array) to the queue using xQueueSend.

    Receiver Task:
        The receiverTask receives the pointer receivedDataPtr from the queue. This pointer is dereferenced to access the actual array ((*receivedDataPtr)[i]), allowing you to print the values stored in sensorData.

    Scheduler:
        The vTaskStartScheduler() function starts the FreeRTOS scheduler, which will execute both tasks.

Key Points:

    The sender sends a pointer to an array (sensorData_t*) to the queue.
    The receiver retrieves the pointer, then dereferences it to access the actual array data.

This way, both tasks can share the same sensorData through the queue.

You want to implement the receiverTask in such a way that it receives sensor data values from the queue using ptrsensorData, and then copies them into a local buffer (received_buffer).

Here's how you can modify the receiverTask to achieve this:
Updated Code for receiverTask:

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
#include <freertos/task.h>
#include <freertos/queue.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 10U
#define NUM_RECEIVES 5

typedef float sensorData_t[ARRAY_SIZE];

sensorData_t sensorData;
sensorData_t *ptrsensorData;  // Pointer to sensorData
sensorData_t received_buffer[NUM_RECEIVES];  // Buffer to hold received data

QueueHandle_t myQueue;

void receiverTask(void *params) {
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_RECEIVES; j++) {
        // Receive the pointer from the queue (with a timeout of 5 ticks)
        if (xQueueReceive(myQueue, (void*)&ptrsensorData, 5)) {
            // Copy the received data into the received_buffer
            for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
                received_buffer[j][i] = (*ptrsensorData)[i];  // Dereference and copy values
            }
        } else {
            printf("Failed to receive data for buffer %d\n", j);
        }
    }

    // Print the received_buffer to verify the data
    for (int j = 0; j < NUM_RECEIVES; j++) {
        printf("Received buffer %d:\n", j);
        for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
            printf("%.2f ", received_buffer[j][i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    vTaskDelete(NULL);  // Delete the task when done
}

Explanation:

    Receiving Data:
        Inside the loop, we attempt to receive a pointer to sensorData from the queue using xQueueReceive. We try this up to NUM_RECEIVES times (5 in your example).
        The queue is read with a timeout of 5 ticks.

    Copying to received_buffer:
        After receiving the pointer, we dereference it to access the actual sensor data ((*ptrsensorData)[i]), and copy the values into the corresponding index of received_buffer.

    Verifying Data:
        After receiving the data, the buffer is printed to verify that the values were received and copied correctly.

Points to Keep in Mind:

    Queue Timeout: If the queue doesn't contain data within 5 ticks, the code prints an error message for that iteration ("Failed to receive data").
    Dereferencing: Since ptrsensorData is a pointer to an array (sensorData_t), we dereference it with (*ptrsensorData)[i] to access each value in the array.
    Printing the Results: After collecting data, the values in the received_buffer are printed to verify the received data.

This way, each call to xQueueReceive retrieves a pointer to sensor data from the queue, and that data is copied into received_buffer.
